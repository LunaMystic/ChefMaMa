### ChefMaMa

Fancy open-source Ingredient-Recipes web apps.

### Prerequisites

You need to set up local web-server in order to run the project. I recommend to use MAMP because I also use MAMP on my computer:) While some of our group member run this project with SimpleHTTPServer:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
```

### Installing

Just put all the file on your htdocs of MAMP, and click index.html

### About webscraper

It is use to construct our json files which contains recipes information, we use the food API to writte the webscraper. See Webscraping files folder.

### About login

We first writte the login authentication but then we find out we want a simple and clear searchsite and there is no need for login, so we discard it. See login authentication folder.
